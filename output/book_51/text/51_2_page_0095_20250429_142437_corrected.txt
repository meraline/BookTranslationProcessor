QUANTUM POKER: The first thing you should do is think about the likelihood of each situation within a range (that you estimate and assign to them), and you need to break that range down into separate categories based on the action they will likely take with different hands within that range. What hands will they bet with, check with, call with, raise with, or fold with? How will their ranges change based on your action? How does that change your strategy? Properly defining your opponent's calling frequency is of the utmost importance when deciding to bet. In online poker, programs like Hold'em Manager (HEM) organize hand histories for you in a way where you can get stats like this, but when playing, it's always over all hands, not specific board textures or situations. This kind of organization and analysis can be very powerful, but without refinement, it's not completely accurate; it's kind of a cure-all for hand range estimations. For example, when looking to c-bet a JT9 two-tone flop, you may look up your opponentâ€™s fold to c-bet stat, but their actual folding frequency will probably not even be close to this stat because the board texture has given so many hands decent equity. It is up to you to determine their folding frequency based on the board texture and hand range. Only use the stats HEM gives you as a guide towards the correct answer.

By breaking down your opponent's ranges, you will likely have actions we will want to make. Let's take a look at the tree of decisions that stems from each possible opponent action:
