        "QUANTUM POKER: Opponent call! If your opponent calls, you move to the next street to make another decision. Depending on who is first to act, there are only a couple of options for how the actions can proceed: If you are first to act, you will either check or bet, and if he is first to act, he will either check or bet. A common occurrence in No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE) is for the person with the lead—the aggressor throughout the hand—to be checked to or to continue betting. When making a calculation, you can estimate that if you are the aggressor, you will get checked to quite often; and if your opponent is the aggressor, you should expect him to bet quite often. Of course, this isn't always the case, and there is a chance other actions can occur, but it can help to generalize sometimes.",
