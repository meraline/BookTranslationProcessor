QUANTUM POKER: Now let's add in our own Mean Value Rectangles: [Figure 4] In real-life situations, there will never be a straight-line equity distribution going to the next street; so we will have to estimate by making our own Mean Value Rectangles. Personally, I make visual estimations that square up the area of an integral on a graph for all similar equity situations. For instance, when set mining, you will have very low flopped equity about 7/8 of the time, but you will have very high equity about 1/8 of the time. Letâ€™s find out what your average equity is versus AA with 66. Here is a mines left chapter on page 94 of 232.
