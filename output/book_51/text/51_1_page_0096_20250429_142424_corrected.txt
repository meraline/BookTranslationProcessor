QUANTUM POKER: Opponent call! If your opponent calls, you move to the next street to make another decision. Depending on who is first to act, there are only a couple of options for how the actions can proceed: If you are first to act, you will either check or bet, and if he is first to act, he will either check or bet. A common occurrence in No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE) is for the person with the lead—the aggressor throughout the hand—to be checked to or to continue betting. When making a calculation, you can estimate that if you are the aggressor, you will get checked to quite often; and if your opponent is the aggressor, you should expect him to bet quite often. Of course, this isn't always the case, and there is a chance other actions can occur, but it can help to generalize sometimes.

If yes, you should consider whether to call or raise. Sometimes it is tough to tell the difference between the two, and people tend to go with the lower uncertainty.
