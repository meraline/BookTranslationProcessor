QUANTUM POKER: The line that represents the 3-barrel? How many different permutations do you see? How many decision nodes do you see for the bettor? It is likely less and less important to study the permutations stemming from each decision, but it is best to study all possibilities to get a full understanding of the game and possibly find new ways to exploit opponents. The goal is to evaluate a hand based on the average enumerated value of all future cards. That is the goal of the UTOP, to find the most optimal way to play each situation.
