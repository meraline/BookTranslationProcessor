Depending on who is first to act, there are only a couple of options for how the actions can proceed: If you are first to act, you will either check or bet, and if he is first to act, he will either check or bet. A common occurrence in No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE) is for the person with the lead—the aggressor throughout the hand—to be checked to or to continue betting. When making a calculation, you can estimate that if you are the aggressor, you will get checked to quite often; and if your opponent is the aggressor, you should expect him to bet quite often. Of course, this isn't always the case, and there is a chance other actions can occur, but it can help to generalize sometimes.\n\nYour options if your opponent bets: [Figure 2-10] If your opponent bets, the first thing you should do is use the pot odds equation to determine if you can call profitably (assuming no future bets). If yes, you should consider whether to call or raise. Sometimes it is tough to tell the difference between the two, and people tend to go with the lower uncertainty.",
  "improve_en_-9090419645375706596": "QUANTUM POKER: The first thing you should do is think about the likelihood of each situation within a range (that you estimate and assign to them), and you need to break that range down into separate categories based on the action they will likely take with different hands within that range. What hands will they bet with, check with, call with, raise with, or fold with? How will their ranges change based on your action? How does that change your strategy? Properly defining your opponent's calling frequency is of the utmost importance when deciding to bet. In online poker, programs like Hold'em Manager (HEM) organize hand histories for you in a way where you can get stats like this, but when playing, it's always over all hands, not specific board textures or situations. This kind of organization and analysis can be very powerful, but without refinement, it's not completely accurate; it's kind of a cure-all for hand range estimations. For example, when looking to c-bet a JT9 two-tone flop, you may look up your opponent’s fold to c-bet stat, but their actual folding frequency will probably not even be close to this stat because the board texture has given so many hands decent equity. It is up to you to determine their folding frequency based on the board texture and hand range. Only use the stats HEM gives you as a guide towards the correct answer.\n\nBy breaking down your opponent's ranges, you will likely have actions we will want to make. Let's take a look at the tree of decisions that stems from each possible opponent action:\n\nYour options if your opponent calls and you are first to act: [Figure 8]\n\nYour options if your opponent calls and he is first to act: [Figure 9]",

[Figure 2.7] If we wanted, we could find the area of all rectangles and then divide by the interval length of 100, but we could also just multiply each frequency by each equity to do the same thing. Since 12 is 12% of the (0,100) interval length, and 0.06 is 6% of the (0,100), etc.\n\nEach situation is a huge factor in what makes one player better than another. Drawing out mean value rectangles can be very helpful. Keep in mind when using the enumeration process, you can clearly see how each situation contributes to the overall strategy.",

Personally, I make visual estimations that square up the area of an integral on a graph for all similar equity situations. For instance, when set mining, you will have very low flopped equity about 7/8 of the time, but you will have very high equity about 1/8 of the time. Let’s find out what your average equity is versus AA with 66. Here is a mines left chapter on page 94 of 232.",
  "improve_en_8439155544121651430": "QUANTUM POKER: There will be no more decisions to make for the rest of the hand, assuming we are going all the way to the showdown with our hand. But we want to think of each decision as part of a multi-street game because each decision matters. If our opponent folds, we win (XP). When our opponent calls and we win (IX WH), and when our opponent calls and we lose (L XI LLV).\n\nWe need to start by thinking about our average equity by street or next street instead of always calculating all the way to showdown. This is important because our decisions on the next street will be based on this information. You want to know how often you have 80% equity (flopped a set), how often you have 35% equity (flopped an OESD), and how often you have different amounts of equity. Knowing future equities is just as important.\n\nI have found there is no program that properly calculates your average EV on the next street, so the best thing we can do is use a graph from propokertools.com, then make some estimations about the Average Function Value—the average equity of a hand (versus a hand or range of hands) on the next street.\n\nLet me give you some brief instructions on how to find the average of that area. The area of this perfect right triangle is 1/2 * base * height. For example, if the base is 100 and the height is 150, then we divide by the interval of the graph in question (0,100). So, 1/2 * 100 * 150 = 7500, and 7500/100 = 75. This makes perfect sense as well.",

Anytime you are trying to determine your opening ranges, you should group hands like this rather than with specific hole cards.\n\nHere we have a very specific flop where we have a backdoor flush draw. That will change our equity when we run out the calculation, and every little bit of equity is very important when trying to make an accurate calculation. Make sure you get your facts right when remembering and writing out a hand.\n\nFold, check/bet, call/raise, and most rarely fold/raise or fold/call/raise. In order to ensure you spend your time learning while you study, try and narrow down your options to the two most suitable actions, then look to enumerate those.\n\nYou must enumerate more than one action in order to be making a full decision. If you are just enumerating one action, then you are just making a more pertinent decision in question.\n\nOpponent Frequencies\n\nLet's write out what opponent frequencies look like logically: when it's pretty commonly accepted as such, just so that you can get to the main point.",

The better your opponent is, the less of an advantage you will have going to future streets, and the less EV they will have with a well-balanced range for each action. Every decision you make in poker is governed by the information you have and your predictions about how each of your decisions will affect the future.\n\nIn a hand of poker, there are a large number of actions to consider. We symbolize the average enumeration of all of those actions given one certain action. Even though \"EV\" is two letters, it is just one term because we are looking for the expected value of each action in question, not just a list of actions. The term \"average\" in math cannot simply use the mean of actions because we are not enumerating the EV of the average action; we are enumerating the EV of all actions and then averaging them. This is the enumeration of all permutations (paths or lines) with which this hand can continue, given action 'A'. This is actually what Z symbolizes.\n\nPart of a Cardrunners EV Simulation.",

It is likely less and less important to study the permutations stemming from each decision, but it is best to study all possibilities to get a full understanding of the game and possibly find new ways to exploit opponents. The goal is to evaluate a hand based on the average enumerated value of all future cards. That is the goal of the UTOP, to find the most optimal way to play each situation."
