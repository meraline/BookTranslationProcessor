While No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE) is my strongest game, the concept of reacting is very common in a poker game. People often talk about reacting with statements like, \"If you keep raising my blind,\" or \"If you bet me one more time.\" These are often empty threats made by players who are either not willing to adjust or incapable of it. It is better to just pay attention, take notes, and adjust without saying anything.\n\nThis is a good start to being a good poker player, but in the end, you need to tell yourself what hands to play based on the information. A beginning player will often sit down at a poker table with a generic mindset.",

Obviously, I think very highly of this program because it quite simply defines all the answers in poker. While it is very slow-moving and a bit complicated to use, you need to get this and spend a day or two messing around in it. It will probably be boring but totally worth it.\n\nFlopzilla: This program is an equity calculator that can be handy for understanding hand strength on future streets. Instead of a mean value, rectangle equity analysis, this program tells you the frequency of your hand's different strengths (top pair, flush, etc.) by each street, all the way to showdown. This is helpful in understanding good bluffing situations and spots where you may be value betting too thinly.\n\nPropokertools.com: This site has an awesome equity calculator that is a must-use for advanced calculations, like determining if calling a 3-bet preflop is going to pay off frequently enough to be worth it.\n\nThe Pyramid Effect: Chapter Page 175 of 202\n\nWhile nosebleed stakes players, rich businessmen, whales, and the upper class dominate tournaments, high stakes players are modeled after the upper class tournaments. Medium stakes players are part of the pyramid effect, which is meant to describe where the money in poker comes from. There are many people feeding the poker economy (and in turn, my expensive tastes in booze and clothes!). Some of the money is against some of the best players in the game, and will almost certainly lose.",

Some of these ideas you may already know, and some may not apply to you, but I believe these concepts will help with your overall confidence and success in poker and in life.\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the four layers of skills acquired by poker players and used to play poker:\n\nFigure 1: On the outer layer, you have your entire information process. This layer deals specifically with previous actions, decisions, and information. Each person has their own logs or memories of other people's actions and what they mean, so each player has their own first-layer concepts. Many people play with only this layer of skill.

So, if we bet the flop, we can expect to show a profit of 1.57P on all of the scare/value cards, which will happen on 21 out of 47 turns. Now, we have to calculate what we do the rest of the time.\n\nChecking the turn: If we bet the turn 21/47, we check the turn the other 26/47 times. Of those times, our opponent will always bet 2P, and we will always call.\n\nPage 114 of 232\n\nRiver (100%): Leading us to the river where we have a few different planned actions based on what card falls. Of the 46 river cards, we will donk lead (bet) 21 of them: spades (2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Q, J) and overcards. On these river cards, we will win 2P + 2P. Our opponent will call 7/46 river cards, and we will win 4P + 2P + 2P. The other 25/46 times, we miss our hand and/or bluff cards; we will check, and our opponent will bet, and we will fold, losing our 1P c-bet and our 2P turn call = 3P.\n\nBetween the 3 separate situations, we expect to net 0.81P.\n\nTurn Check/Call (100%) into River:\n\n- Our Action | Opponent Action | Frequency | Profit\n- Fold: 14/46, 2P + 2P = 2.20P\n- Call: 7/46\n- Bet: 25/46, -2P + 1P = -1.63P\n\nEV = 2P + 1.22P - 1.63P = 0.81P\n\nRemember, we ignore any losses from decisions made before the c-bet (i.e., raising preflop) because we want to know the value of the c-bet, not any situations that came before it.\n\nOverall Turn Value and therefore Flop C-bet Value: EV = 32x.",

Let's now calculate the value of each permutation that stems from the continuation. In this chapter, we will discuss the 21 cards we will bet and the 26 cards we will check. Starting with betting the turn (refer back to the diagram to follow along or just take my word for it), there are 21 turn cards that we will bet out of the 47 possible. \n\nOn the flop, we bet and were called, so the pot is 3P. Of this, 2P is profit (it was already our money). So we win 2P, not 3P, 14/47 or 29.79% of the time. We win 2P if all-in, let's say it’s 6P on average (assuming we always win or assuming our equity is 6P). \n\n31/47 or 65.96% of the time, we will bet the river with these cards: 25, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, J5, Qs.

Many people don’t plan properly for the next street; they just bet blindly or check-call without thinking about it in depth—just using an instinctive approach. When you write out the decision process like this, you can begin to see which strategy is fitting for which card, and how each street benefits you. You won't be caught off guard or unprepared anymore. Now, let's add in the next street with similar assumptions, except we need to consider additional factors.",
