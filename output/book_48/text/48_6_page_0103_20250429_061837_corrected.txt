QUANTUM POKER: Turn Bet Analysis

Turn Bet Analysis (21/47), Out of Position Action:

- All-in: 1/47
- 2P + 6P: 0, call 6/47, 6.24P (see Fig 4-17)
- River Bet (100%) after Turn Bet Analysis: EV = 7.855

Opponent Action Frequency:
- Fold: 20/46, 20/46 * 4P = 1.74P
- Call: 26/46, 2P + 2P + 4P, 26/46 * 8P = 4.5P

Total: 1.74P + 4.5P = 6.24P

This enumeration gives us the value of betting a favorable turn card after making our flop c-bet. So, if we bet the flop, we can expect to show a profit of 1.57P on all of the scare/value cards, which will happen on 21 out of 47 turns. Now, we have to calculate what we do the rest of the time.

Checking the turn: If we bet the turn 21/47, we check the turn the other 26/47 times. Of those times, our opponent will always bet 2P, and we will always call.

River (100%): Leading us to the river where we have a few different planned actions based on what card falls. Of the 46 river cards, we will donk lead (bet) 21 of them: spades (2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Q, J) and overcards. On these river cards, we will win 2P + 2P. Our opponent will call 7/46 river cards, and we will win 4P + 2P + 2P. The other 25/46 times, we miss our hand and/or bluff cards; we will check, and our opponent will bet, and we will fold, losing our 1P c-bet and our 2P turn call = 3P.

Between the 3 separate situations, we expect to net 0.81P.

Turn Check/Call (100%) into River:

- Our Action | Opponent Action | Frequency | Profit
- Fold: 14/46, 2P + 2P = 2.20P
- Call: 7/46
- Bet: 25/46, -2P + 1P = -1.63P

EV = 2P + 1.22P - 1.63P = 0.81P

Remember, we ignore any losses from decisions made before the c-bet (i.e., raising preflop) because we want to know the value of the c-bet, not any situations that came before it.

Overall Turn Value and therefore Flop C-bet Value: EV = 32x.
