        "QUANTUM POKER: There are 47 different turn cards, and we have broken them down. Let's now calculate the value of each permutation that stems from the continuation. In this chapter, we will discuss the 21 cards we will bet and the 26 cards we will check. Starting with betting the turn (refer back to the diagram to follow along or just take my word for it), there are 21 turn cards that we will bet out of the 47 possible. ",
