QUANTUM POKER: Quizzes and simulations will help your short-stack game and your Cardrunners EV.

Flopzilla: This program is an equity calculator that can be handy for understanding hand strength on future streets. Instead of a mean value, rectangle equity analysis, this program tells you the frequency of your hand's different strengths (top pair, flush, etc.) by each street, all the way to showdown.
