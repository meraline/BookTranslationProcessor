Table Captain = a person who is extremely active at the table, probably playing lots of pots and being very aggressive. They may be a maniac, spewing off tons of money, or a strongly adjusted pro who sees tons of room for value in their loose play. Figuring out which one they are is your choice.

Weakness = any action that narrows an opponent's range to hands that don't have a lot of equity/EV, or hands that will fold to a reasonable bet.
