        "QUANTUM POKER: To play a hand the best way, you need to take some time out of your day for tougher games and still sessions. Believe in yourself and stay confident to run the math. There is no substitute for understanding the equities over time, and with many hours of dedication, you will make the best decisions. One range versus another, or the frequency at which someone will call or fold to a shove, can bring you closer to being the perfect player. The tiniest difference in how you perceive a folding frequency and what it actually is can mean the difference between a winning play and a losing one. Work hard and take responsibility for your own results; don't blame your results on things like variance or downswings.
