We are, of course, concerned with the EV of each decision: EV of a bet or raise, EV of a call, and EV of a check. If none of these are +EV, then you must fold.\n\nSo let's start with a logical condition statement:\n\n1. If (GLA > CLA) and (Ca > SAR), then bet.\n2. If (CR > I) and (Cad > CLAM), then call.\n3. If (ER > Aa) and (kaa > Edi), then check.\n4. If (0 > EH) and (0 > Ea) and (0 > EV), then fold.\n\nThis is really straightforward, yet people often make decisions like:\n\nHere is what we have learned throughout the course of the book on the values of EV for single street decisions:\n\n- (ER) = XP + (1-X) WHLLV\n- (Ea) = C/(C3P)\n\nWhile we haven't officially defined it, I think we can agree that the EV of a check looks something like this:\n\n- (C=) = EV of hand versus range(s) going to the next street * Pot size * % chance of going to the next street without having to put money in the pot + the added value of how your opponent responds differently.\n\n- (CR) = p * IE 22 = o for opponent y and n for each of the n opponents (if there is only one opponent, then n=1), then a multiplication of the chance of each of them checking.\n\nExample: There are two opponents left to act, and each one will check half of their hands: 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. If one of the opponents does not...",

This illustrates the importance of having a good setup, being able to see each table clearly, and not having to worry about timing out or misclicking. Notice that for a lower number of tables, each person is making the same amount. So, if you are a weaker multi-tabler, getting a nice poker setup is crucial.\n\nNumber of Tables:\n\n3.

It’s because the number of hands we get to fold increases more than the percent of the pot we risk.\n\nAs we change our bet size (P - we are betting in terms of pot size), we need to get more folds (X). This means if you increase your bet by 50%, you need to get 25% more folds, and as you increase your bet size from 75P to 1.5P in this example, you get more folds than the required 25%.\n\nThis idea may have been something you already knew or intuitively understood; it's commonly understood that if you bluff half pot, you need to win 1/3 of the time to break even, and if you bluff full pot, you need to win 1/2 the time.

Meanwhile, 73 out of 82 will fold to any 1.25 PSB or higher, and 9 will not fold to any bet. \n\nTake a look at this graph and pay close attention to the inflection points. In No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE), we have many different choices of what size to bet. However, if we want to exploit our opponent best, we should consider betting just over 1.25 PSB. This graph indicates that to best exploit our opponent, we should adjust our bet size accordingly.\n\nPage 45 of 212 (23% complete)",
  "improve_en_7858587265125215829": "QUANTUM POKER: 10% of Hands\n\nThis graph represents the true value of KQs. 20% of the time, you will flop a very strong hand, like top pair or better, which is often the best hand. Another 20% of the time, you will flop a draw with some overcards. After that, there is always some wiggle room for bluffing. Already being able to play back at 40% of flops sounds pretty good to me, even though some situations put KQs into the trouble hand category. There is a lot of strength to the hand when not against the tightest range.\n\nUsing graphs like this is how I try to actualize the value of my hand. I try to mentally estimate how often I have over 30%, over 50%, and over 80% equity. This helps all of my decisions, including set mining, calling a 3-bet, knowing when to float the flop, and knowing when a bluff or semi-bluff raise can be profitable. If I am looking at my equity versus a range and see that KQs is over 40% with just two overcards and a backdoor flush draw, it seems like a good time to float or raise. Many players make clear mistakes by just folding the hand because they whiffed (no pair, no clear draw). It's important to utilize your equity and not forfeit it. This will lead to higher variance, but more importantly, it will lead to a higher win rate and more money in your pocket.\n\nLet's take a look at the same hand, but against the top 5% of hands. It has 30%+ equity on only 25% of flops.\n\nThis exemplifies the power of correctly analyzing an opponent's range. If you think someone is 3-betting 10%, but they are actually 3-betting 5%, you can be making an incorrect call. So pay attention to your opponents! Your equity going from street to street (like flop to turn) are two different things. The first can be easily calculated in PokerStove, and the second requires more nuanced judgment.",

  "improve_en_7294431893317273366": "QUANTUM POKER: Chapter 1 - The Introduction\n\nPoker is a complex decision-based investment game where your cards and information gathering determine your equity, and it is up to you to make the proper decisions to ensure the highest possible return on each decision, both consciously and subconsciously, due to your base of experience, memory recall, mood, and ability to recognize similar situations. Intuition can result in good and close-to-correct decisions but is missing many key factors and doesn’t utilize some of the fundamental mathematics and combinatorics found in the game. \n\nThe second aspect is complex math that takes all factors into account and correctly determines the best decision given your inputs. This is ideal but impractical because no one can solve such a problem in their head, and they are confined by the amount of time allowed in a hand. So, let's start by acknowledging that perfection will always be at arm's length: we can get close to it, but we will never truly reach it. \n\nBetween this truth and the truth that there is a sucker born every minute (just meaning people with poor decision-making speed), throughout this book, I intend to teach and reinforce specific mathematical and logical procedures that should help you better balance intuition and reinforce your decision-making process."
