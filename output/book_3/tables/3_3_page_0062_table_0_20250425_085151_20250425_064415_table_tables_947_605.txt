Table content: This is a graph that has 20 sample runs of what it could look like if you
are a 3bb/100 (estimated) winner in the same game. Notice all samples
have made money, and a good amount at that! The difference in variance
is staggering between a marginal winner and a strong winner. The strong
winner is pretty much guaranteed money at the end of the year, while the

marginal winner is much more likely to go broke and be forced to quit
