Table content: This is a graph that has 20 sample runs of what it could look like if
you are a 1bb/100 (estimated) winner in a game with 80bb/100 standard
deviation - most NLHE 6-max players/games. Over 1,000,000 hands (you
could feasibly play this many hands in a year), about 10% of 1bb/100
winners are still down. This is a bit scary if you are trying to make a living

playing poker and are only a small winner.
