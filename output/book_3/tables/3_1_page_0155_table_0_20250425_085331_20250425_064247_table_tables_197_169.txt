Table content: However, it appears that most of the money coming into a stake level
comes from the people that frequent that stake level the most. Some of
the middle and upper working class may start out in the mid-stakes where
they play and lose on a regular basis. Other rich businessmen and whales
may only get good entertainment value from poker by playing high stakes
games, inevitably losing their money there. While I used to believe that
most of the money moved up the pyramid, upon further review, it appears
that the money comes in from the bad regulars at a much higher rate than

the one-time stake-jumping players.
