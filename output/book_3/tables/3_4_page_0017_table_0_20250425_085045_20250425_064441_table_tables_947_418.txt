Table content: Quantum Mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior
of matter and its interactions with energy on the scale of atoms and atomic
particles. In one particular thought experiment called Schrédinger’s cat
there is a situation in which a cat left in a box has been dealt a fate of
either being alive or dead based on a random event. While the experiment
was never done, of course, there was an uncertainty about the state of
the cat until it was observed. In poker, we experience this uncertainty
all the time when we are trying to figure out our opponents hole cards.
There are many different states their hole cards can be in and we will
not be sure which hand they have until we observe it. At that moment,
the waves of possibilities collapse to particles and become known hole

cards. Unfortunately, all relevant (and valuable) decisions are always made
