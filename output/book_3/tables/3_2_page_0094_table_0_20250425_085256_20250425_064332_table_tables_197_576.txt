Table content: This example doesn’t have a specific answer because it all depends on
your opponent (and I didn’t even specify hole cards). The idea here is to
open your mind to the true value - be it EV or AZV - of your decision. Even
though it’s a lot to take in, try to think about all of this information before
deciding to check back a street.
