Table content: During our enumeration of a check, we need to enumerate the times
‘we will be able to make profitable bets later combined with the times we
are not the equity favorite but can still profitably call, versus the times we
become a significant equity loser and must fold to our opponent’s bet. Each
permutation that ends in folding loses us .5P because we could have bet the
flop to capture that .5P, but instead we checked leading to a 0 EV play. Each
permutation that ends in us only being able to call is not likely to yield us as
much as our .5P bet would have if we had made it on the flop. (This is just
my assumption based on how NLHE equities tend to run and the fact that
people like to bet close to the pot size so we won't be getting great odds.)
And when we can make a profitable bet on the turn, we need to make sure
‘we are averaging more than the original .5P.
