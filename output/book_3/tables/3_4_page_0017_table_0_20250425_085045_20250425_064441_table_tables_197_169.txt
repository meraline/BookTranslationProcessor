Table content: There are three ways to play poker: a losing way, a winning way, and
the right way. Most players are losers and play for fun using a strategy
that is easily taken advantage of by a better one. Many people are winning
players, but are constantly making mistakes. Some believe they are using
the perfect strategy, after all they are making money, others are just overly
cautious, acknowledging their mistakes, but claiming they want to “avoid
variance.” And a rare few are too loose, usually because they want to win

the pot in front of them, or because they are too impatient.
