Table content: Statistically - I think this is kind of a wash. It could mean they understand
EV, or pot odds, or something, but it could also just be a really poor
interpretation of how to play the game. They could be thinking that
statistics are what drives decisions, and not combinatorics, enumeration,

and hand ranges.
