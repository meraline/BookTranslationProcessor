Table content: > Limp-reraising all their strong hands - Okay I want to reiterate
the fallacies of the limp-reraise. Firstly, it gives away your hand
strength, secondly it weakens your raising range, and thirdly it
allows people like me to limp behind and suck out for dirt cheap. A
lot of fish like to only limp-reraise with their super strong hands,
like: TT+,AK, but occasionally some players will do it with small
pairs “hoping” you have AK or will fold. Pay attention to how often
they limp, and how often they limp-reraise, and this will give you an
idea of how they play. And always pay attention and remember any
hands shown after a limp-reraise. Once you identify a limp-reraiser,
you should isolate raise smaller and less frequently, and limp behind

more often.
