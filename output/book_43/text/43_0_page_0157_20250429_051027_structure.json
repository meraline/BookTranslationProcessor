        "It's important to instantly and correctly adjust to any strategy set forth by your opponents. While No-Limit Hold'em (NLHE) is my strongest game, the concept of reacting is very common in a poker game. People often talk about reacting with phrases like, \"If you keep raising my blind,\" or \"If you bet me one more time.\" These are often empty threats made by players who are either not willing to adjust or incapable of it. It is better to just pay attention, take notes, and adjust without saying anything.",
        "This is a good start to being a good poker player, but in the end, you need to tell yourself what hands to play based on the information. A beginning player will often sit down at a poker table with a generic mindset."
